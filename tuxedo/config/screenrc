# Screen configuration for tuxedo workspaces
# Enables mouse wheel scrolling through tmux by disabling alternate screen

# Note: We don't use 'shell' here because we need init-env.sh to run AFTER
# the shell's rc files. The shell is started via tuxedo-shell.sh wrapper
# which is passed as a command argument when screen is invoked.

# Enable truecolor support for Claude Code and other terminal apps
truecolor on
setenv COLORTERM truecolor

# Large scrollback buffer (10k lines)
defscrollback 10000

# Disable alternate screen - allows tmux to capture scrollback
# ti@ disables the "enter alternate screen" sequence
# te@ disables the "exit alternate screen" sequence
# Match all common terminal types
termcapinfo * ti@:te@

# Disable screen's own visual bell and other UI that might interfere
vbell off

# Make screen not grab mouse events - let tmux handle them
