# Alternate screen mode (default: enabled)
# When enabled, full-screen apps (vim, less, man) use a temporary screen
# and don't pollute the scrollback buffer - saves significant memory.
# Disabled (ti@:te@) would allow tmux to capture all output but causes
# memory bloat with long-running sessions.
