# Claude Code Notes

## Commit Guidelines

- Do NOT add co-author lines to commits (no "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or similar)
- Do NOT add "Generated with Claude Code" footers to commit messages
- Do NOT force push unless explicitly instructed to do so.
- Do NOT use `--no-verify` to bypass git hooks.
- Do NOT commit or push to the `main` branch, if you are on `main`, create a new branch.
- Do NOT use `any` typings or `as` TypesScript assertions.
- Do NOT decrease code coverage thresholds. Always write tests for new code.
