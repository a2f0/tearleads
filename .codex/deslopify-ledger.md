## Summary

- Date: 2026-08-07
- Repository: `a2f0/tearleads`
- Baseline command: targeted `packages/app` document-type test suite
- Baseline status: 102 tests passed
- Golden behavior: existing DOM, sorting, editing, attribution, and
  secret-masking assertions

### 2026-08-07 - Tracker document family

- Status: accepted
- Classification: parametric duplication
- Equivalence claim: Weight, Blood Pressure, and Env File keep their public
  components, labels, selectors, validation, formatting, row order, sorting,
  edit lifecycle, attribution, and Env File secret handling while sharing the
  repeated tracker shells.
- Risk notes: React hook lifecycle, targeted row editing, and secret display were
  the primary risks. Domain-specific field rendering and validation remain in
  the document-type modules.
- Files changed: tracker document types plus shared tracker document, index,
  read-card, quick-add, row-model, and store helpers.
- Baseline: 102 targeted tests passed before the refactor.
- Verification: TypeScript build and the same 102 targeted tests passed after
  the refactor; broader repository checks run before shipping.
- Delta: 1,065 lines removed from existing family files before accounting for
  the focused shared implementations.
- Decision notes: accepted because each extracted seam represented the same
  lifecycle or rendering envelope with domain behavior supplied explicitly.
